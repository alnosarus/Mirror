MIRROR - Complete Brief
---
## THE PROBLEM
Organizations can't predict how infrastructure failures cascade. When ports close, bridges collapse, or power grids fail - it takes weeks to understand the damage. By then they've lost tens to hundreds of millions. Current tools simulate single systems in isolation and take days, consultants take 6 months for static reports. Nobody can show cross-domain cascades in real-time.
---
## THE SOLUTION
Mirror simulates infrastructure disruptions in 60 seconds and shows exactly what breaks, when, and how much it costs.
User asks: "Port of LA closes for 2 weeks"
Mirror shows:
- Day 3: Alternate ports hit capacity
- Day 8: Inventory warnings at 200+ facilities
- Day 12: Production stops at 15 factories
- Total: $8B economic impact
- Actions: Air freight costs $300K, prevents $84M loss
3D visualization + AI plain-English report + specific recommendations with ROI.

## WHY WE'RE DIFFERENT
**Zero competition in universal real-time simulation:**
vs Engineering Tools: They simulate ONE system (power OR water), take 8-24 hours. We simulate ALL systems simultaneously (power → water → supply chain → economy) in 60 seconds.
vs Supply Chain Software: Resilinc/Everstream send alerts AFTER disruptions start. We simulate BEFORE they happen.
vs Consultants: They charge $2M, take 6 months, deliver static PowerPoint. We do unlimited scenarios, real-time, $1M/year.
**The breakthrough:**
- Cross-domain modeling (first to show cascades across different infrastructure types)
- Real-time speed (parallel processing from video game engines, 100x faster)
- Hidden pattern detection (AI finds correlations humans miss)
- First-mover in winner-take-all market (18-month head start)

## HOW IT WORKS
**Data Layer (pre-loaded):**
- City infrastructure: Roads, power lines, ports, water systems (OpenStreetMap, Overture Maps - free/public)
- Customer operations: Their facilities, suppliers, inventory levels (they provide during onboarding)
**User Input:**
- Natural language: "What if Port of LA closes for 2 weeks?"
- LLM (GPT-4) parses → structured parameters
**Simulation Engine (Rust + Bevy):**
- Network graph: Nodes (infrastructure) + Edges (connections)
- Physics simulation: 100K+ entities, cascading failures across domains
- Runs 14-day scenario in 60 seconds (real-time parallel processing)
**Output:**
- 3D visualization: Watch cascade spread (color-coded facilities: green → yellow → red)
- Timeline: Hour-by-hour/day-by-day events
- Economic impact: Dollar cost per day
- AI report: Plain English summary with recommendations

## FIRST CUSTOMER (Year 1 Focus)
**Who:** Pharmaceutical manufacturing companies
**Why pharma:**
- Complex global supply chains (APIs from India/China)
- Recent pain fresh (COVID supply shocks)
- High willingness to pay ($500K-$2M/year is rounding error)
- Clear ROI (one drug shortage = $50-200M loss)
- Regulatory pressure (FDA requires supply chain resilience)
- Concentrated market (50 major pharma companies in US)
**Use case:** "What if our Shanghai supplier shuts down for 3 weeks?"
**Why start here:** Fastest to revenue, clearest pain, easiest to validate ROI.
---
## GENERAL CUSTOMER (Year 2-3 Expansion)
**Target:** Manufacturing & production companies with complex supply chains
**Includes:**
- Pharmaceutical (Year 1 focus)
- Automotive (just-in-time vulnerable)
- Electronics (chip shortage pain)
- Consumer goods (P&G, Unilever scale)
- Aerospace/Defense (critical supply chains)
**Pain point:** All have suppliers → manufacturing → customers. All vulnerable to disruptions cascading through operations.
**Why they pay:** Single prevented disruption ($50-200M) pays for software 50-200x over.
**Later expansion:**
- Infrastructure operators (utilities, ports, water systems)
- Government (DoD, FEMA disaster planning)
- Financial institutions (hedge funds trading on disruptions, insurance underwriting)
---
## THE MARKET
**Size:** $7.6B+ TAM
- Manufacturing companies: $30-50B addressable
- Infrastructure operators: $4B
- Government: $2.5B
- Financial: $600M
**Competition:** Zero direct (no universal real-time cross-domain simulator exists)
**Economics:**
- Customer pays: $500K-$2M/year
- Costs us: $25-50K/year (compute + data)
- Gross margin: 95%+
- LTV: $7-10M (7-year customer lifetime)
- CAC: $200K (enterprise sales)
- LTV/CAC: 35-50:1
